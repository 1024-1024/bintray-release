gradle-android-release-plugin
=============================

A helper for releasing from gradle on bintray


### Info from the dev team

 > I just pushed a branch in merlin to show how to use the plugin https://github.com/novoda/merlin/tree/publish_with_plugin
 > unfortunately we just tried to publish and it creates the repo on bintray but without uploading files
 > as you can see it is the same way we use on the plugin to publish itself using the previous version
 > but with that we used your gist, given that the plugin was not complete
 > to publish with the pugin the command is ./gradlew -PbintrayUser=USERNAME -PbintrayKey=BINTRAY_KEY -PshouldUpload=true publishReleaseToBintray
